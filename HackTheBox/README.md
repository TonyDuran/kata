# Welcome
This directory holds write-ups to my HackTheBox solves. The plan is to publish my solutions as markdown files that anyone can read. I will do my best to always give credit where credit is due.

Please feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_TonyDuran), if you have questions/suggestions.

## Long-term Goals

### Host write-up content to a website
The write-ups will live in this directory for now. Eventually, move them to blog posts on either a hosted site or my [GH Page](https://tonyduran.github.io/).

### Stay Consistent
While professionally I want to stay/be a Software Engineer. I really enjoy ethical hacking. With consistent practice, I might consider getting a cert and/or do live contests for fun.

### Stay Challenged
Ideally, I'd like to build my own malware (ethically) or research cutting-edge vulnerabilities. So hopefully, this repository can grow into something more than just problem solves.
